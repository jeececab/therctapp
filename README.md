App / website project for rock climbing training using material from The Rock Climber's Training Manual by Michael L. Anderson and Mark L. Anderson. It will be better to also get the book to fully understand and execute the program. The app / website will be to design your own program based on the book and then schedule it, try to follow it and log your progress.
